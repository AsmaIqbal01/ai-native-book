# Chapter 2: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Chapter Overview
This chapter introduces the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), the middleware that connects AI systems to robotic hardware. Students will learn the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 architecture including nodes, topics, services, and actions, with practical examples using Python and rclpy.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this chapter, students will be able to:
1. Explain the architecture of ROS 2 and its core components
2. Create and run basic ROS 2 nodes using Python
3. Implement the publish/subscribe pattern for data transmission
4. Use services for request/response communication
5. Implement actions for long-running tasks with feedback
6. Bridge Python agents to ROS 2 controllers for robot control
7. Understand and modify URDF robot descriptions
