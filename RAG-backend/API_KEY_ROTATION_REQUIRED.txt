⚠️  IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED - ROTATE API KEYS
================================================================================

Your .env file contains exposed API keys that must be rotated before deployment.

AFFECTED KEYS:
1. OpenRouter: sk-or-v1-... (check your .env file)
2. OpenAI: sk-proj-... (check your .env file)
3. Qdrant: eyJhbG... (check your .env file)

ACTION STEPS:
1. Visit each provider's dashboard
2. Delete/revoke the old key
3. Generate a new key
4. Update your .env file with the new key
5. Delete this file after completing the rotation

PROVIDER URLS:
- OpenRouter: https://openrouter.ai/keys
- OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Qdrant: [Your Qdrant Cloud Dashboard]

WHY: These keys were found in your .env file during audit. While .env
is properly excluded from git (not committed), rotate as a precaution.

See SECURITY_GUIDE.md for detailed instructions.
