# Introduction to AI-Native Robotics

Welcome to **AI-Native Robotics** - your comprehensive guide to building intelligent robotic systems that seamlessly integrate artificial intelligence, perception, and physical action.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This textbook takes you on a journey from fundamental concepts to advanced implementations in robotics and AI. By the end, you'll be able to:

- **Design and build** intelligent robotic systems from scratch
- **Integrate AI models** with physical robots for real-world tasks
- **Simulate and test** robots in digital twin environments
- **Deploy vision-language-action (VLA)** models for embodied AI
- **Master industry-standard tools** like ROS2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac

## 🤖 Why AI-Native Robotics?

The robotics landscape is undergoing a fundamental transformation. Traditional robots followed pre-programmed rules and operated in controlled environments. **AI-Native Robots** are different:

- **Learn from experience** using machine learning and neural networks
- **Understand natural language** commands and context
- **Perceive their environment** using computer vision and sensor fusion
- **Adapt to changes** in real-time without reprogramming
- **Collaborate with humans** in unstructured environments

This shift represents the convergence of:
- 🧠 **Artificial Intelligence** (deep learning, foundation models)
- 👁️ **Computer Vision** (perception, scene understanding)
- 🦾 **Robotics** (manipulation, navigation, control)
- 🌐 **Simulation** (digital twins, synthetic data generation)
